# SemperScribe RMF Readiness Pre-Draft

Pre-draft of artifacts an RMF Security Control Assessor would request, prepared voluntarily ahead of any DoD sponsorship. This is not an authorization package and does not substitute for one.

- Last reviewed: 2026-05-23
- Document version: 1.0
- System: SemperScribe Proof of Concept
- Repo: https://github.com/furby203824/SemperScribe
- Current ATO status: None. Not under RMF scope per DoDI 8510.01 paragraph 1.1.

## 1. RMF Step 1. Categorize

### System Description

SemperScribe is a client-side single-page application that helps users draft, format, and export USMC correspondence documents (letters, memoranda, directives, AMHS messages). The application processes only data the user enters in the browser. It performs no server-side processing. It maintains no system of records. It has no users in the access-control sense; anyone with a web browser can access the deployed static site.

### FIPS 199 Categorization

Per FIPS PUB 199, "Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems," and NIST SP 800-60.

| Security Objective | Potential Impact | Justification |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Confidentiality | Low | The system processes only user-entered text. By design, it does not collect, store, or transmit PII, CUI, or other sensitive information. Disclosure of compromise of in-browser session data would have a limited adverse effect on the user. |
| Integrity | Low | The system processes a document draft on behalf of the user. Unauthorized modification would result in a malformed draft, not corruption of an authoritative record. Federal records are created downstream when the user uses the output officially; that record handling is out of scope for this system. |
| Availability | Low | The system is static and reproducible from source. Loss of availability of the GitHub Pages deployment would not prevent users from generating documents using a local clone or alternative deployment. |

**Overall Categorization. Low.**

### Information Types

Per NIST SP 800-60 Volume 2 information type mapping.

| Information Type | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| C.3.5.4 General-Purpose Productivity Software (assistance) | Low | Low | Low |

No higher-impact information types apply because the system does not collect or store data on behalf of the Federal government.

## 3. RMF Step 3. Implement Controls

Implementation status summarized in the tables above. Detailed implementation evidence lives in:

- `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` (SSDF practice mapping)
- `docs/COMPLIANCE_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` (audit trail)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (build, SBOM, deploy automation)
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (static analysis)
- `SECURITY.md` (disclosure channel)
- `LICENSES.md` (third-party inventory)
- `LICENSE` (project license)
- `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` (privacy notice)

## 4. RMF Step 4. Assess Controls

Self-assessment posture only. No SCA has performed an independent assessment. If sponsored to ATO, an SCA would assess each control per the Status column above plus any supplementary controls the AO requires.

## 5. RMF Step 5. Authorize

Not authorized. No AO has reviewed this system. Use is at user discretion only.

If sponsored:

- Recommend Provisional Authorization based on Low impact categorization.
- Recommend conditional reciprocity for any subsequent DoD Component deployment.

## 6. RMF Step 6. Continuous Monitoring

Active controls reviewed on the cadence below.

| Activity | Cadence | Trigger |
|----------|---------|---------|
| CodeQL static analysis | Every push, every PR, weekly Monday | Automatic via GitHub Actions |
| npm audit | On dependency change | Manual `npm audit` |
| SBOM generation | Every deploy | Workflow `Generate SBOM` step |
| License inventory review | On direct dependency change | Manual update to LICENSES.md |
| Compliance plan refresh | When material policy or architecture changes occur | Manual |
| RMF readiness review | Annually or on material policy or architecture change | Manual |

## 7. Boundary Diagram

Text representation of the system boundary.

```
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  User's Web Browser                        |
|  (Browser sandbox is the authorization boundary)           |
|                                                            |
|   +-----------------+        +----------------------+      |
|   |  SemperScribe   |        |  Browser localStorage|      |
|   |  static bundle  |<------>|  (user drafts only)  |      |
|   |  (HTML/JS/CSS)  |        +----------------------+      |
|   +-----------------+                                      |
|           ^                                                |
+-----------|------------------------------------------------+
            |
            | HTTPS (same origin)
            |
+-----------v------------------------------------------------+
|              GitHub Pages CDN (https://furby203824.         |
|              github.io/SemperScribe)                       |
|  Serves static HTML, JS, CSS, woff2 font files.            |
|  No backend logic. No database. No API endpoint.           |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Build-time only. The CI/CD pipeline contacts the npm registry, fonts.googleapis.com (via next/font/google self-host), and GitHub Actions infrastructure. None of these are contacted at runtime by users.

## 8. Authorization Boundary Definition

For the purpose of FIPS 199 and NIST SP 800-37 RMF, the authorization boundary is.

- The static export bundle hosted on github.io.
- The browser-side localStorage where user drafts persist.
- The user's browser session.

Out of the boundary.

- GitHub.com itself (handled by GitHub's separate compliance posture).
- The user's workstation operating system.
- Any network the user is on.
- Any downstream system the user routes a generated document through (e.g., email, EDMS, official records repositories).

## 9. Risks Accepted

| Risk | Severity | Rationale for Acceptance |
|------|----------|--------------------------|
| Deprecated inflight package transitive | Low | Memory leak only impacts long-running Node processes. SemperScribe build is short. |
| MPL-2.0 axe-core transitive | Low | Dev-only dependency, not in production bundle. Approval gap closes if PoC moves to formal release. |
| No formal SLA for vulnerability response | Low | Personal PoC. Documented in SECURITY.md. |
| No coordinated disclosure process | Low | Documented in SECURITY.md. Best-effort triage. |

## 10. Conditions for Authorization

If a DoD Component sponsors this PoC for ATO, the following gaps would need closure.

- Formal vulnerability response SLA aligned with the sponsoring Component's expectations.
- Component CIO approval for MPL-2.0 axe-core per OSS Guidance paragraph 3G.
- Records management EIS registration per MCO 5210.11F if the tool is to be used officially.
- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) per OMB M-03-22 if PII processing becomes a possibility.
- Migration from github.io public hosting to a DoD-approved hosting environment per the sponsoring Component's policies.
- Continuous monitoring tied to the Component's RMF Knowledge Service tooling.
