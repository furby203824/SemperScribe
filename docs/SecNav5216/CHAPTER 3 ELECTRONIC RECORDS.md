# CHAPTER 3: ELECTRONIC RECORDS

## 3-1 General

**1. General.** An electronic record is any information that is recorded in a form that only a computer can process and that satisfies the definition of a Federal record (SECNAV M-5210.1 Department of the Navy Records Management Manual, part I, paragraph 17) -- information made or received in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for presentation as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, operations, etc, or because of its information value. Electronic documents, including e-mails, are Federal records to the same extent as their paper counterparts would be. In practice, there is no difference between managing electronic and paper records.

## 3-2 Procedures

**1. Creation.** Before a document is created on an electronic records system that will maintain the official file copy, each document must be identified sufficiently to enable authorized personnel to retrieve, protect, and dispose of it. When feasible, create the electronic record within a DoD certified electronic Records Management Application (RMA), such as Hewlett Packard Total Records Information Management (TRIM) Context, or another DON approved RMA, using procedures established for record creation within the RMA.

**2. Naming Files.** Naming electronic files resembles labeling paper file folders. When naming subdirectories or “folders,” use the Standard Subject Identification Code (SSIC) (SECNAV M- 5210.2, Department of the Navy Standard Subject Identification Code (SSIC) Manual) and any logical combination of alphanumeric characters permitted by the operating system and descriptive of the series.
* *Example:* A subdirectory labeled 5240 would show “General Administration and Management” files containing correspondence on industrial methods that are destroyed after 5 years.
* Identifying information for each document may include the office of origin, the SSIC, key words for retrieval, addressee (if any), signature, originator, date, authorized disposition (coded or otherwise), and security classification (if applicable). Ensure that electronically maintained records can be correlated with related records on paper, microform, or other media. When creating within, or transferring to, an approved RMA, comply with specific naming, identification and tracking requirements established for the RMA.

**3. Maintenance.**
* **a.** Electronic records that are not created within an approved RMA, or an Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) within the required RM functionality should be transferred to one as soon as practicable within 6 months of the record creation date. However, electronic records whose disposition schedule permits destruction within 6 months of the date the record was created need not be transferred to, or maintained within, an approved RMA if destroyed within that 6 month period. Once an electronic record is within an approved RMA, adhere to the maintenance requirements established for that RMA. Pending transfer into an approved RMA, or when an approved RMA is not available, adhere to the procedures in paragraphs 3b through 3d below to protect electronic records.
* **b.** Make backup copies of files at least once a week. Do not use removable media storage devices for long-term storage of permanent or unscheduled records because removable media storage devices are vulnerable to mishandling and data loss is common. When removable media storage devices are the only backup medium available, use them for temporary storage only. If possible, store the backup media in a separate area from the source data to provide additional insurance against data loss. As noted in the preceding paragraph, these backup procedures are not required for an electronic record maintained in an approved RMA.
* **c.** Equipment failure and power outages are additional causes of data loss. Save files frequently. When using a word processing program, set the auto save feature to every 5 minutes.
* **d.** Store frequently used files conveniently for immediate access. Store less frequently used files on disk or other media.
* **e.** Account, control, and destroy classified information under the guidelines contained in the DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3. Be sure the records you maintain are necessary and pertinent. Appropriately destroy non-essential records.

**4. Restrictions.**
* **a. FOIA.** The FOIA allows any person to seek access to records held by a Government agency. See SECNAVINST 5720.42F, Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), for information on processing requests.
* **b. Privacy Act.** The purpose of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. §552a) is to balance the Government’s need to maintain information about individuals with the rights of individuals to be protected against unwarranted invasion of their privacy stemming from Federal agencies’ collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information about them. As such, limit access to personal data and other restricted documents.
* **c. Electronic Records as Evidence.** Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. §1074), electronic records are acceptable to the courts as evidence; however, each judge is free to dismiss evidence on the basis of the court’s independent evaluation.

**5. Disposition.**
* **a.** Identify and schedule electronic versions of official records for disposition. Refer to SECNAV M-5210.1.
* **b.** Erase electronic files used only as backup files or that only contain passing information once a hard copy has been generated or when the data is no longer needed.
