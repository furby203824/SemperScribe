# CHAPTER 2: CORRESPONDENCE STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES

## 2-1 Correspondence Standards

1. **General.** To a large degree, the image and effectiveness of the DON is portrayed by the tone, quality, and responsiveness of correspondence. Properly written correspondence that clearly and succinctly establishes a position, correctly and completely answers questions, and conveys the right message, all aid in the effective management and operation of the DON. In order to achieve this, correspondence must:
    * **a.** Be neat in appearance, correctly formatted, error free, and grammatically correct. With the use of computers and advanced word processing software, the long-accepted practice of allowing legible “pen and ink” changes to a piece of correspondence is no longer acceptable. All correspondence shall be free of typographical errors and technically correct before it is signed.
    * **b.** Avoid stereotyping men and women based on gender. Use pronouns and titles that are gender neutral.
    * **c.** Do not write unless you must. A conversation in person, by telephone, or by electronic mail (e-mail) often saves two letters - the one you would have written and the other person’s response. Conversations are often better than correspondence for working out details. Confirm your conversation with a short memorandum (also referred to as “memo”) to the other person or a “Memorandum For The Record” if issues of importance or policy are agreed upon during the conversation.
    * **d.** Always include a point of contact, return telephone number, and e-mail address when your correspondence might prompt a reply or inquiry.

2. **North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).** When writing to other NATO Forces, use the format and abbreviations in NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) Number 2066, Layout for Military Correspondence. STANAG Number 2066 is stocked by the Naval Aviation Supply Office (ASO), 5801 Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120-5099.

## 2-2 Procedures

1. **Correspondence through Channels**
    * **a. Use the Chain of Command.** Follow your chain of command when corresponding on substantive matters such as command decisions, policy issues, and official recommendations.
        * (1) Address communications directly to the top official of the organization concerned by title. Show the action office by including the code or person’s title in parentheses immediately after the activity’s name.
        * (2) Address correspondence concerning policy, management decisions, or other important matters via the chain of command or those commands, activities, or offices who have cognizance over the subject matter. This keeps intermediate commands informed and allows them to comment or approve as necessary.
        * (3) A “Via” addressee will always forward official correspondence with an endorsement. The endorsement may be as simple as using the term “forwarded” when no opinion or comment is needed. A “Via” addressee may elect to take final action, divert the routing, or return the correspondence to the originator with appropriate explanation (chapter 9).
        * (4) When there is no time to send important correspondence “Via” the chain of command and still meet a deadline, you may:
            * (a) Send correspondence via the chain of command, with an advance copy to the “To” addressee. To alert all addressees to this unusual routing, repeat the action addressee by Standard Navy Distribution List (SNDL) short title in a “Copy to:” line and include the term “(advance)” after the short title (chapter 7).
            * (b) Send correspondence directly to the “To” addressee with a concurrent copy to each intermediate addressee. Include in the text a statement like this: “A copy of this correspondence has been mailed directly to all addressees. Request “Via” addressees forward your endorsement(s) directly to....” Additionally, include the “Via” addressees by SNDL short titles in the “Copy to:” line.

    * **b. Variations to Corresponding Through the Chain of Command**
        * (1) Authorized subordinates of different activities may correspond directly with each other on routine matters.
        * (2) List any cognizant addressees in the “Via:” line when it is determined that they should see a letter before it reaches the “to” addressee.
        * (3) Include intermediate commands as “Copy to” addressees instead of “Via” addressees if you want them to see certain routine correspondence without having to endorse it.
        * (4) Bypass intermediate commands that clearly have no interest in a letter’s content and no requirement to comment or act.

    * **c. Individuals Writing to Higher Authority**
        * (1) **Navy Personnel.** When writing to higher authority on a personal matter affecting the command, prepare your letter on plain bond paper in standard letter format. Examples include requests for retirement or resignation. Address the letter to the higher authority and send it “Via” your chain of command. Each “Via” addressee will prepare an endorsement and forward the correspondence to the next addressee.
        * (2) **Marine Corps Personnel.** Use NAVMC 10274, Administrative Action (AA) Form, as prescribed in Marine Corps Order 5216.19 (MCO 5216.19).

2. **Take Advantage of Correspondence Shortcuts**
    * **a. E-mail.** You can use e-mail for formal and informal correspondence. See chapter 4 for additional information.
    * **b. Facsimile Machines.** Facsimile machines provide a fast and reliable means for sending official correspondence (chapter 5).
    * **c. Window Envelopes.** Window envelopes eliminate the cost of addressing envelopes and the risk of putting letters in the wrong envelopes. To format letters for use with window envelopes see page 7-18. It should be noted that the window-envelope letter format has no “From:” line, so every copy that goes outside your activity must be on letterhead to show its origin. Do not use a window envelope for material that:
        * (1) Is classified.
        * (2) Involves national security.
        * (3) Is of a personal nature.
        * (4) Is sent to high-level officials.
        * (5) Is FOUO.
    * **d. Form and Guide Letters.** Periodically review correspondence for recurring, routine topics that can be addressed with a standard response. This standard response can be developed into a form or format letter to save time. See “Form and Guide Letters, an Information Resources Management Handbook by the General Services Administration (GSA).” This handbook is available through the Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) system.
        * (1) Use form letters when possible for routine matters that require no personal touch. Avoid form letters when expressing sympathy, apology, or appreciation.
        * (2) Guide letters are pre-drafted standard letters that contain paragraphs that you may pick from to best fit the situation for which you are writing. Type or print them individually so they seem personally composed.

3. **Coordination.** Coordination is a critical step in the processing of outgoing correspondence. In order to ensure that a proper response or original letter is prepared, the originator will need to decide who needs to concur before the letter is signed. The originator will obtain appropriate concurrences, resolve major differences, and arrange for any needed retyping.
    * **a.** Always coordinate during the drafting stage, before the correspondence is put into final form and submitted for signature. Ensure all coordination inputs are retained and filed with the file copy of the signed correspondence.
    * **b.** Limit reviews to only those offices that have a substantial interest in the topic of the correspondence.
    * **c.** In some cases, coordination can be done quickly and informally. Discussions by phone or in person or coordination via e-mail are often more efficient than formal written coordination, especially if a letter is brief and routine.

4. **Submit Finished Products for Signature.** Submit correspondence for signature in final form. Use double-spaced drafts only when changes are likely, perhaps because a subject is controversial or a policy statement needs precise wording. Alternatively, submit correspondence electronically, using track changes for review. Early guidance to writers about a signer’s preferences will reduce the frequency of changes.

5. **Signature Authority.** Delegate signature authority to the lowest legal and practical level.
    * **a. What the Commander/Commanding Officer/Officer in Charge Must Sign.** The commander/commanding officer/officer in charge must personally sign documents that:
        * (1) Establish policy.
        * (2) Center on the command’s mission or efficiency and are addressed to higher authority.
        * (3) Deal with certain aspects of military justice.
        * (4) Are required by law or regulation.
    * **b. Delegation of Signature Authority**
        * (1) Delegation of signature authority may be made to military and civilian subordinates. All delegations of signature authority will be made in writing and signed by the person delegating the authority. If the delegation of authority is provided for in a directive, indicate this delegation in a generic reference to a billet or position title. For each individual that the delegation of authority applies, a letter so delegating that authority to the individual, by name, will be prepared. Include a brief outline of the scope of delegation, and if appropriate, authorize the individual to further delegate or sub-delegate the authority. In the absence of specific sub-delegation guidance, delegated signature authority shall not be sub-delegated.
        * (2) An individual who signs correspondence under delegated authority will use the term “By direction” typed below their name when signing documents under this delegated authority. Refer to chapter 7.
    * **c. Acting for the Commander/Commanding Officer/Officer in Charge.** In the absence of the commander/commanding officer/officer in charge, and where specifically authorized by law or regulation, an officer who temporarily succeeds to command shall sign official correspondence with the term “Acting” typed below their name.
    * **d. Acting for an Official Who Signs by Title.** When the signatory has been formally, but temporarily, appointed to replace an official who signs correspondence by title rather than “By direction,” the word “Acting” is typed below the typed name.
    * **e. Signing “For” an Absent Official.** When correspondence is in final form and the official that would normally sign the correspondence is unable to do so, it is permissible to have the correspondence signed “for.” Rather than modifying the document to replace the signature line, an individual already delegated signature authority may sign the correspondence and hand write the term “for” before the typed name of the regular signing official. This method should be used only when a delay would fail to meet a crucial deadline.

6. **Electronic Signatures.** Commanders/commanding officers/officers in charge or civilian equivalents may authorize the use of an electronic signature that replicates his or her signature where personal signing of a piece of correspondence is impractical or the correspondence is of a routine nature. Personnel authorized to use a signature stamp of someone else’s signature shall pen their initials next to each signature they stamp to authenticate the stamp. Safeguard signature stamps from unauthorized use.

7. **Incoming Correspondence Controls.** Controlled correspondence is correspondence that requires some type of action, requires a response, or has long-term reference value.
    * **a. Date Stamp.** Date stamp all incoming controlled correspondence on the day it arrives at the command. It is a good practice to date stamp all incoming correspondence, not just controlled correspondence.
    * **b. Restrict Assignment of Controls.** Assign controls to only incoming mail that requires a response or has long-term reference value. Incoming action correspondence should be routed directly from the correspondence management office to the action office. If necessary, send duplicate copies to intermediate or coordinating offices.

8. **Replies to Correspondence**
    * **a. Controlled Correspondence.** Take prompt action on incoming correspondence that requires action or a response. Normally, correspondence should be answered within 10 working days or as prescribed by the immediate superior in command or by the tasking authority for the response.
    * **b. Congressional Correspondence**
        * (1) Reply directly to members of Congress if they contact your activity on routine and non-policy matters. When doubt exists over whether to release certain information, contact the Office of Legislative Affairs for guidance.
        * (2) Correspondence from Congress shall be answered within 5 workdays of receipt. If a response (refer to chapter 12, page 12-3 for guidance on preparing an interim response) cannot be provided within 5 days, send an interim response that acknowledges receipt of the correspondence and provides an estimated date when a final response will be sent. Send the original response plus an additional copy when responding to a Congressional Inquiry. Also, send a blind copy of your final reply and substantive interim replies to:
            * CHIEF OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS NAVY DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON DC 20350-1000
        * (3) The opening line in the text of the response should read, “Thank you for your letter of [date], concerning [issue].” NOTE: The date format is month day, year (i.e., June 19, 2009).
        * (4) When responding to a Congressional request, the closing line in the text of the response should read, “If I may be of any further assistance, please let me know.”
        * (5) For more information on the handling of naval legislative affairs refer to SECNAVINST 5730.5J, Mission, Function, and Responsibilities of the Office of Legislative Affairs and Procedures for Handling Legislative Affairs and Congressional Relations.
    * **c. Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Requests.** Answer Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and Privacy Act requests within 20 workdays of receipt. If a response cannot be provided within 20 days, send an interim response that acknowledges receipt of the correspondence and provides an estimated date when a final response will be sent. Ensure all responses for FOIA information and Privacy Act information is reviewed by the base or command FOIA and Privacy Act Coordinator or the base or command Judge Advocate General.

9. **Outgoing Correspondence Controls**
    * **a. Impose Realistic Due Dates.** When sending correspondence that requires a response or has action for the recipient, put a “reply by” due date in your letter only when you have a compelling reason to receive a response back by that date. When choosing the due date, allow time for your letter to make its way up the chain of command to be signed, time for it to reach the people who will take action, time for them to gather information and prepare a response, and time for the response to make it back to you.
    * **b. Sign and Mail.** Correspondence should be signed at intervals throughout the day. This method will keep signed correspondence from lingering overnight before it goes out. Arrange for a special trip to the mailroom for important correspondence that is signed after the last regular messenger and before the last mail dispatch. Alert the mailroom to the urgency.
    * **c. Trace Late Replies.** If a response is not received within a reasonable amount of time or by the directed “reply by” date, follow up with the command that the correspondence was sent to. There are two methods to follow up on late correspondence:
        * (1) Forward a copy of the original correspondence with the term “TRACER – [date]” written or stamped in the top margin.
        * (2) Contact the command that the correspondence was originally sent to by phone or via e-mail.

10. **Limit Use of Social Security Numbers (SSN).** Memorandums, letters, spreadsheets, hard copy lists, electronic lists and surveys that collect, use, or maintain the SSN must meet acceptable use criteria and all other required Privacy Act considerations. Commands shall ensure that a review of these collections is conducted to determine that there is an authoritative basis and requirement for continued SSN use. If no authority or legal requirement exists, the collection and use of the SSN shall cease unless and until such authority is obtained. In certain environments where continuity of operations requires the use of the SSN in memorandums, letters, spreadsheets, hard copy lists, electronic lists or surveys, approval by local commanders can be granted. Effective 1 October 2015 all memorandums, letters, spreadsheets, hard copy or electronic lists and surveys that collect, use, or maintain the SSN shall be eliminated unless justification for continued use of the SSN can be verified. After 1 October 2015, potential exceptions shall undergo a documented review and justification process similar to the requirements for official forms and IT systems. Each exception must meet acceptable use criteria and all other required Privacy Act considerations. The list of Acceptable Use Criteria can be found at: http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?id=1833.

11. **Identifying Navy and Marine Corps Personnel.** This information is generally included in the subject line of the standard letter and in the first paragraph of the business letter. Fully identify the member when you first mention him or her. In later references to the member, simply use the rank or rate and last name. Do not capitalize every letter of a member's last name, except in the subject and signature lines. Capitalize the words "Sailor," "Marine" and “Service Member” when referring to members of the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps.
    * **a. Navy Requirements**
        * (1) Abbreviated rank for officers and rate and warfare designator for enlisted personnel (e.g., AD1(AW), BM2(SW), CSSN(SS)) with no space between rank/rate and warfare designator,
        * (2) first name, middle initial if any, and last name,
        * (3) staff corps abbreviation (if any),
        * (4) branch of service,
        * (5) the 10-digit Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier (EDIPI), referred to as the DoD ID number (should be used as a substitute for the SSN whenever possible). The last four digits of the SSN (when use of the SSN is justified),
        * (6) the designator for an officer.
    * **b. Marine Corps Requirements**
        * (1) Unabbreviated grade,
        * (2) first name, middle initial if any, and last name,
        * (3) the 10-digit Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier (EDIPI), referred to as the DoD ID number (should be used as a substitute for the SSN whenever possible). The last four digits of the SSN (when use of the SSN is justified),
        * (4) military occupational specialty, and
        * (5) branch of service.

12. **Letterhead Stationery.** The standard size paper for all official letterhead stationery is 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches. Preprinted or computer generated letterhead is acceptable. Use white, plain bond paper. Refer to appendix C for stationery usage guidelines.
    * **a. Use of Letterhead Stationery**
        * (1) Use command letterhead stationery only for official matters of the command. Printing names of officials on letterhead stationery is prohibited. When using letterhead stationery, the “From:” line will always contain the title of the activity head and command name. The “From:” line will never contain the name of an individual.
        * (2) Use command letterhead stationery when corresponding as a member of a DON approved board or committee. Indicate the letter is from the signing official by using the board or committee title in the “From:” line.
        * (3) Do not use letterhead as personal stationery. For example, CDR Baker, captain of the ship’s basketball team, may not use it for matters involving the team.
        * (4) The use of letterhead is authorized for commanders, commanding officers, officers in charge and directors or those who have signature authority for commands that are represented in the SNDL only.
    * **b. Letterhead Format**
        * (1) Letterhead stationery of the DON shall bear a one-inch in diameter seal of the DoD. Other seals, emblems, insignia, decorative or emblematic devices shall not be incorporated. See appendix C for additional guidance.
        * (2) The letterhead begins with "DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY" centered on the fourth line from the top of the page. Center the activity's name, address, and nine-digit zip code on succeeding lines. Do not use abbreviations or punctuation in the address.
        * (3) The address lines of letterhead for Navy activities shall conform to the SNDL address for that activity. Marine Corps activities shall comply with current Marine Corps Directives Management Program, MCO 5215.1K.

13. **Enclosures.** An enclosure can prevent a letter from becoming too detailed. Try to keep letters short, down to one page whenever possible, and use enclosures for lengthy explanations that cannot be avoided. An enclosure may include such things as manuals, publications, photocopies of correspondence, charts, etc. belonging to the specific DON organization only. No external documents area allowed to be enclosures. Consider making them references instead.
    * **a. Marking Enclosures.** Enclosures must be marked on the first page; however, you may mark all pages. An enclosure marking goes in the lower right corner, whether the text is arranged in portrait or landscape orientation. Type “Enclosure” and its number in parentheses. Arrange the typed pages lengthwise so they can be read from the right.
    * **b. Numbering Pages of Enclosures.** Number only second and later pages. If you have several different enclosures, number the pages of each independently.
    * **c. Sending Enclosures Separately.** When size, weight, or other factors prevent sending an enclosure with a letter, send it separately and type “(sep cover)” after the enclosure’s description.

14. **Copies.** Keep in mind the following when reproducing paper copies:
    * **a.** Use two-sided photocopying whenever possible.
    * **b.** If your letter must have “Copy to” addressees, include only those with a genuine need to know. Be realistic.
    * **c.** Avoid “just in case” copies and whole batches of 10 or 15 copies when you can pinpoint the quantity precisely.
    * **d.** Make the most of the “read, initial, and date” approach to information copies within your command. Circulate a single copy among those who need to read the document, and have them pass it on.
    * **e.** Distribute copies by e-mail or put information copies on your local area network. If using either of these two methods, distribute the copy in approved File Access Mode (FAM) software application format.
    * **f.** Avoid redundant file copies. Keep official command files in one central location to simplify access. Retain one official file copy of all outgoing correspondence.

15. **Expressing Military Time.** Express military time in four digits based on the 24-hour clock. The time range is 0000 to 2359. The first two digits are the hour after midnight and the last two digits are the minutes. Do not use a colon to separate the hour from the minutes.

16. **Expressing Dates.** There are three date formats allowed for use in Navy correspondence. The formats and their use are described below. In all date formats, the day is represented as one or two digits (do not use a zero preceding the numerals 1 through 9 when the day is single digit). The abbreviated format and the standard format are used when corresponding with other military organizations. The civilian format is used when corresponding with Congress, civilian agencies and businesses, and individuals.
    * **a. Abbreviated Format.** The abbreviated format is only used as part of the sender’s symbol, or in the absence of the sender’s symbol, as the date for the letter. The format consists of a 1- or 2-digit day, the 3-letter abbreviation for the month, and the 2-digit abbreviated year.
    * **b. Standard Format.** The standard format is only used in the text of correspondence. The format consists of a 1- or 2-digit day, the spelled out month, and the 4-digit year.
    * **c. Civilian Format.** The civilian format is used as both the date of the correspondence and in the text. Do not use an abbreviated civilian format. The format consists of the spelled out month, the 1- or 2-digit day, a comma, and the 4-digit year.

17. **Abbreviations and Acronyms.** Abbreviations and acronyms are one of the most misused aspects of correspondence. When using abbreviations and acronyms the writer must consider the audience. What is familiar to you may not be familiar to the reader. The use of abbreviations and acronyms tends to detract from the content of the correspondence by causing the reader to have to pause, remember what the abbreviation or acronym means, then continue reading.
    * **a.** Established abbreviations are acceptable in all but the most formal writing (e.g., directives) where every abbreviation and acronym must be identified no matter how well known. Some examples include “Mr.” (Mister), “Ms.” (Miss), “e.g”. (for example), “i.e.” (that is), and “etc.” (et cetera), “sonar” (sound navigation and ranging), and “radar” (radio detecting and ranging).
    * **b.** Do not abbreviate military titles in the text of press reports.
    * **c.** If you use an acronym, spell it out first and then define the acronym in parentheses. After the initial definition, the acronym may be used without explanation.

18. **Punctuating, Capitalizing, Spelling, Hyphenating, and Separating Words.** For examples on punctuating, capitalizing, and spelling, refer to the Government Printing Office (GPO) Style Manual. Most word processors eliminate the need to divide words. If correspondence is produced manually, use the Word Division Book, a supplement to the GPO Style Manual or your dictionary for help with dividing words. Use hyphens sparingly; a slightly uneven right margin is preferred over hyphenated words. Never hyphenate a word at the end of a page. Avoid separating words in close association such as a person’s name, abbreviated titles, and dates. If a full name must be split, do so after the first name when there is no initial, or after the initial. Never split the name of a ship.

19. **Proofreading.** Proofread correspondence several times and check it carefully to ensure it has been correctly prepared. A recommended method of proofreading is:
    * **a.** Check format first. Do not read for substance until you are sure everything else is right.
    * **b.** Look at the framework of the correspondence:
        * (1) Is letterhead correct/straight?
        * (2) Are the margins 1 inch?
        * (3) Are page numbers centered 1/2 inch from the bottom of the page?
        * (4) Is there enough/too much room for the date?
        * (5) Are paragraphs aligned/indented properly?
        * (6) Are paragraphs sequentially numbered/lettered?
        * (7) Are enclosure markings correct?
        * (8) Are more than three lines hyphenated, and are successive lines hyphenated?
        * (9) Is there enough room for the signature line?
        * (10) Is the header margin 1 inch from the top of the page?
        * (11) Is the footer margin ½ inch from the bottom of the page?
    * **c.** Next, look for typographical errors, misspelled words, improper punctuation, improper spacing, and incorrect grammar:
        * (1) Read slowly. Look at each word separately.
        * (2) Look up all hyphenated words you are not sure of.
        * (3) When using a word processing program, use spell check and grammar check; however, never solely depend on this method. Utilize spell check and grammar check as an additional tool.
    * **d.** Lastly, read for content.

20. **Typeface.** For text, use 10 to 12 point font size. Times New Roman 12-point is the preferred font style and size for official correspondence, but Courier New may be used for informal correspondence. Bold, underline, script, and italics may be used for occasional emphasis, but not for entire letters.

21. **Color of Ink.** Suggested colors of ink for editing of correspondence: Activity Head (RED), Deputy/Executive Officer (GREEN), Heads of Administration (PURPLE), Heads of all other Departments (BLUE). Only use black or blue-black ink to sign correspondence. Photocopiers pick up these colors well.
