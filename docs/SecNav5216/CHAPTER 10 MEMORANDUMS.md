# CHAPTER 10: MEMORANDUMS

## 10-1 General

**General.** A memorandum provides a less formal way to correspond within an activity/command. Subordinates within that activity or command may use a memorandum to correspond directly with each other on routine official business or as an informal means of communication.

---

## 10-2 Formats

There are several memorandum formats. All DON activities shall use the appropriate memorandum that suits the subject, occasion, and audience. The following paragraphs discuss the different types of memorandums:

**1. Memorandum for the Record.** Use a Memorandum for the Record (MFR) as an internal document to record supporting information in the record that is not recorded elsewhere. Examples include such things as documenting the results of a meeting, an important telephone conversation, or an oral agreement. Type or handwrite these most informal memorandums. See figure 10-1. A full signature line and identification symbols are not required; however, it should be dated, signed, and show the organizational position of the signer. If it is only two or three lines, include it on the file copy of your document. Leave out the subject line if you add your MFR to the file copy.

**2. From-To Memorandum.** Use OPNAV 5215/144A DON Memo (8-1/2 x 11) or OPNAV 5215/144B DON Memo (8-1/2 x 5-1/2) for the “from-to” memorandum. Memorandum may be directed to one or more addressees. If very informal, it may be handwritten. If the subject is insignificant, a file copy is not required. See figure 10-2.

**3. Plain-Paper Memorandum.** Use plain-paper memorandums for informal communications within your activity. It is no more formal than the memorandum form, but it is more flexible when there are multiple addressees, via addressees, or both.
* **a. Identification Symbols.** The only identification symbol you need is the date, unless local practice calls for more.
* **b. Format.** Prepare on white bond paper. Type the date on the sixth line so it ends flush with the right margin, unless it is used as part of the senders symbol. See figures 10-3 and 10-4.

**4. Letterhead Memorandum.** The letterhead memorandum may be used within your activity and provides more formality than the printed form or plain-paper memorandum. When direct liaison with individuals outside of your activity is authorized, the letterhead memorandum may be used to correspond on routine matters that neither make a commitment nor take an official stand. A full signature line is not required because the “From:” line identifies the signer. See figure 10-4. For example: You have been appointed chairperson of a committee and need to correspond with other members of the committee outside your activity.

**5. Decision Memorandum.** When only requesting an approval/disapproval decision from a single addressee, it is appropriate to type a decision block at the left margin, two lines below the signature line in the following format:
```text
COMMANDING OFFICER DECISION:
Approved _________________
Disapproved ______________
Other ____________________


6. Memorandum of Agreement or Memorandum of Understanding

a. Use. The Memorandum of Agreement or Understanding may be used to document mutual agreements of facts, intentions, procedures, limits on future actions, and areas of present or future coordination, or commitments, etc. If a Memorandum of Agreement or Understanding is initiated by a non-DoD activity, DON activities are authorized to use their format.

b. Format. Center “MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT” on the second line below the date line. Center “BETWEEN” on the next line and follow with the names of the agreeing activities (centered). To prepare a “Memorandum of Understanding”, substitute those words for “Memorandum of Agreement,” and follow the same format as shown in figures 10-5 and 10-6. Number and letter paragraphs and subparagraphs the same as other correspondence. The basic text may contain, but is not limited to, the following titled paragraphs:

(1) Purpose. This paragraph defines or states in as few words as possible, the purpose of the agreement.

(2) Problem. Present a clear, concise statement of the problem, to include a brief background.

(3) Scope. Add a short statement specifying the area covered by the agreement.

(4) Agreement, Understanding. Spell out the agreement or understanding and responsibilities of and between each of the parties involved.

(5) Effective Date. Enter the date the agreement will take effect.

c. Letterhead. On plain bond, type the command titles so the senior is at the top. If the activities are in different cities or states, follow each title with its address.

d. Signatures. Arrange signature lines so the senior official is at the right. Place the signature line of a third cosigner in the middle of the page. Precede all signature lines by over scoring as shown in figures 10-5 and 10-6. The senior activity should sign the agreement after the junior activity(ies).

e. Copies. The activity signing last should send copies of the agreement to all cosigners.
