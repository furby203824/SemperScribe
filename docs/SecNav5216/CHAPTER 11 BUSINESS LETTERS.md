# CHAPTER 11: BUSINESS LETTERS

## 11-1 General

**General.** Use the business letter to correspond with agencies, businesses, or individuals outside DoD, who are unfamiliar with the standard letter. It also may be used for official correspondence between individuals within DoD, when the occasion calls for a personal approach. Before reading further, review figures 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3.

## 11-2 Parts of a Business Letter and Format

**1. Identification Symbols.** Include the following three identification symbols in the upper left corner, blocked one below the other:
* **a.** SSIC;
* **b.** Originator’s code; and
* **c. Date.** Write the date in month-day-year order. The month is written out in full, followed by the day in Arabic numerals, a comma, and the full year also in Arabic numerals, e.g., May 23, 2014.

**2. Inside Address.** Place the inside address two to eight lines below the date, blocked flush with the left margin. Placement of the inside address may be adjusted depending on the length of the letter or local policy. Refer to figure 11-4 for proper placement of the inside address when preparing a letter for use with a window envelope.
* **a. If your letter is directed to a particular individual, include the:**
    * (1) Addressee’s courtesy title (Mr., Mrs., Ms.) and full name;
    * (2) business title (Vice President, Accounting), if appropriate;
    * (3) business name;
    * (4) street address; and
    * (5) the city, state, and ZIP+4 code on the last line. Note new requirement for only one space between state and ZIP code vice two to five spaces.
* **b. If your letter is directed to a business in general, include the:**
    * (1) Business name;
    * (2) full street address; and
    * (3) the city, state, and ZIP+4 code on the last line.

**3. Attention Line.** An attention line is optional. Use it to direct your letter to a business in general and to also bring it to the attention of a particular person or department at the same time. Start typing two lines below the last line of the inside address, blocked flush with the left margin, and two lines above the salutation. See figure 11-5. Refer to figure 11-4 for proper placement of the attention line when preparing a letter for use with a window envelope.

**4. Salutation Line.** Capitalize the first letter of the first word of the salutation as well as the first letter of the addressee’s courtesy title and surname such as “Dear Mr. (or Ms., Mrs., Miss, Dr., Captain, Lieutenant) Jones,” followed by a colon.
* **a. If your letter is addressed to:**
    * (1) An all male organization, use a salutation such as “Gentlemen” or “Dear Sirs.”
    * (2) An all female organization, use a salutation such as “Ladies” or “Mesdames.”
    * (3) A mixed gender organization, or if you are not sure of the gender mix, use a collective salutation such as “Ladies and Gentlemen” or “Dear Sir or Madam.”
    * (4) A business in general, but directed to the attention of a particular person or department, use a collective salutation such as “Ladies and Gentlemen.”
* **b.** If you cannot determine the gender of the addressee from previous communications, omit the courtesy title (Mr., Mrs., Ms., etc.) and address the individual by first name or initial(s) and last name such as “Dear Lee Doe” or “Dear L. Doe.”
* **c.** Refer to appendices A and B for models of address and salutations. Start typing on the second line below the last line of the inside address or attention line, flush with the left margin.

**5. Subject Line.** Use of a subject line is optional and may replace the salutation. The subject line should be very brief, to the point, and not be more than one line in length, if possible. Capitalize every letter in the subject line. See figure 11-2.
* **a.** If the subject line is replacing the salutation, start typing on the second line below the last line of the inside address or attention line, flush with the left margin.
* **b.** If the subject line is in addition to the salutation, start typing on the second line below the salutation line.

**6. Body of the Letter.** Single-space within paragraphs and double space between paragraphs. Indent main paragraphs four spaces (or set margin at half inch) and start typing on the fifth space. Do not number main paragraphs. The first lines of subparagraphs should be indented, and lettered or numbered in standard letter fashion. See figure 11-1. A business letter that is likely to run eight lines or less, may be double-spaced. Figure 11-6 is an illustration of a short business letter.

**7. References and Enclosures.** Refer to previous communications and enclosures in the body of the letter only, without calling them references or enclosures.

**8. Complimentary Close.** Use “Sincerely” followed by a comma for the complimentary close of a business letter starting at the center of the page on the second line below the text.

**9. Signature Line**
* **a.** Start all lines of the signature line at the center of the page, beginning on the fourth line below “Sincerely.” Type or stamp the following information:
    * (1) Signer’s name in all capital letters, with the exception of a last name starting with a prefix.
    * (2) Military grade (if any) spelled out,
    * (3) Functional title, and
    * (4) Authority line. The authority line may be omitted on a routine business letter that neither makes a commitment nor takes an official stand.
* **b.** Women’s names may begin with “Miss,” “Mrs.,” or “Ms.” One exception to this would be when using “Mrs.” plus the writer’s husband’s name, which would appear like this: “MS. ALBERT B. SEAY” or “MRS. A. B. SEAY.”

**10. Enclosure Line**
* **a.** Type “Enclosure” on the second line below the signature line, number and describe them briefly.
* **b.** If the enclosures are insignificant, you do not have to describe them in the enclosure line. Type “Enclosures” and the number of enclosures within parentheses: Enclosures (2).

**11. Separate Mailing.** When an enclosure is to be sent separately, type “Separate Mailing” and a brief description.

**12. “Copy To:” Line.** If everyone should know that a particular addressee will receive an information copy, show that addressee by using a copy notation. Type “Copy to:” at the left margin on the second line below the enclosure line, if any, or the signature line. List addressees at the left margin or following “Copy to:”. Use long titles for activities listed in the SNDL.

**13. Outgoing Copies.** Because the business letter does not have a “From:” line, every copy that goes to addressees outside your activity must have a letterhead copy (printed, typed, stamped, or reproduced from the original) to show its origin.

**14. Identifying Second and Succeeding Pages.** Repeat the identification symbols, from the first page, on the sixth line from the top at the left margin. Continue the text beginning on the second line below the identification symbols. See figure 11-3.

**15. Numbering Pages.** Do not number a single-page letter or the first page of a multiple-page letter. Center page numbers 1/2 inch from the bottom edge, starting with the number 2. No punctuation accompanies a page number. (To number the pages of a Top Secret document, see DoDM 5200.01-V2.)

Dear Mr. Seay:

SUBJECT: PREPARATION OF A BUSINESS LETTER

    This example shows the first page of a two-page business letter. A subject
line is optional, but if used may replace the salutation. Phrase the subject
line in normal word order. Make it very brief, to the point, and not longer than
one line. Capitalize every letter in the subject line.

    Refer to previous communications and enclosures in the body of the letter
only, without calling them references or enclosures. Do not number main
paragraphs. Subparagraphs are numbered and lettered the same as a standard
letter.

    Start a paragraph near the end of a page only if that page has room for two
lines or more. Continue a paragraph on the following page only if two lines or
more can be carried over. A signature page must have at least two lines of text.

    Do not number the first page of a single page letter or multiple page
letter. The first page is assumed to be page 1. Center page numbers 1/2 inch
from the bottom edge, starting with the number 2. No punctuation accompanies a
page number.

SUBJECT: SUBJECT LINE AND WINDOW-ENVELOPE FORMAT

    [C & A Tool Company,] In this example the subject line is used in place of
the salutation. This is allowed on routine administrative letters. The first
sentence serves as a greeting to the reader as shown above in [ ]. Start typing
the identification symbols on line 10, just below the seal. Always start the
address on line 16; the salutation or subject line on line 25.

    You may use a number 10 window envelope if the entire address takes no more
than five lines, it does not extend past the middle of the page, and the letter
and all enclosures are unclassified. The full address must appear in the window
no matter how the letter may shift in the envelope.

    To fold the letter, turn up the bottom edge so it just covers the subject
and then turn back the address portion so the upper fold also falls along the
top of the subject.



                                      Sincerely,

                                      ANN C. PHILLIPS

Ms. Jane Ryan
J. M. Corporation
287 Duke Street
Newton, CA 93333-4321

Dear Ms. Ryan:

    This is an illustration of a short business letter. There are several
techniques you may use to balance the appearance of a letter containing 100
words or less:

    a. Start the inside address up to eight lines below the date.

    b. Use side margins of up to two inches.

    c. In a letter containing eight lines or less, you may double-space
throughout the text.

    {Note proper use of Ms. in parentheses in signature line.}



                                      Sincerely,

                                      (Ms.) S. JONES
