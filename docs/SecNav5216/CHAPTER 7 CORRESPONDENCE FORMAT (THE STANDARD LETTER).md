# CHAPTER 7: CORRESPONDENCE FORMAT (THE STANDARD LETTER)

## 7-1 Requirements

**1.** Use the standard letter format or one of its variations to correspond officially within or outside the DoD.

**2.** The format of the standard letter, with slight variations, sets the pattern for joint letters, multiple-address letters, endorsements, directives, memoranda, etc. Refer to the two-page letter illustrations at figures 7-1 and 7-2. Figure 7-3 contains the formatting techniques to use when preparing a standard letter for use with a window envelope. Figure 7-4 is an example of a joint letter for joint release by two commands.

**3.** The person whose title appears in the “To:” line is the action addressee. Aside from its one action addressee, the standard letter may have any number of “Via” addressees, “Copy to” addressees, or both. See chapter 8 to prepare a letter with more than one action addressee.

---

## 7-2 Format

**1. Margins.** Allow l-inch top, bottom, left, and right margins on each page. On letterhead paper, typing starts more than 1-inch from the top when the letterhead is printed. Do not right, center, or full justify text or use proportional spacing. Per OPNAVINST 5215.17, directives headers are 1 inch and footers are .5 inches.

**2. Font.** Spacing and alignment of headings following the “From:” line will vary based upon the font utilized. The instructions and examples provided below are typed using the preferred font of Times New Roman.

**3. Sender’s Symbols.** If “in reply refer to” is printed on your activity’s letterhead paper, type the Standard Subject Identification Code (SSIC) on the next line. If “in reply refer to” is not printed on your activity’s letterhead paper, type the SSIC on the second line below the letterhead, starting 2 inches or more from the right edge of the paper. The longest line of the sender’s symbol should end close to the right margin.
* **a. Authorized Sender’s Symbols.** A sender’s symbol for a standard letter has three parts:
    * (1) **Standard Subject Identification Code.** An SSIC is a four- or five-digit number which represent a document’s subject. They are used to categorize information by subject and are required on all Navy and Marine Corps messages, directives, forms, and reports. To find the SSIC that most closely represents the subject, refer to SECNAV M-5210.2.
    * (2) **Originator’s Code, By Itself or in a Serial Number.** The originator’s code, with or without the serial number, is the originator's office symbol or the hull number of a ship. Each command or activity will determine makeup of the originator’s code.
        * (a) **Originator’s Code Without Serial Numbers.** Start the originator’s code immediately under the SSIC.
        * (b) **Originator’s Code With Serial Numbers.** All classified correspondence created by your activity must be given a serial number. A serial number is not required on unclassified correspondence. Whether unclassified correspondence is serialized or not depends on local practice. Volume is the major criterion. An activity that uses serial numbers shall start a new sequence of numbers at the beginning of each calendar year and assigns numbers consecutively beginning with 001.
        * (c) **Classified Markings.** Start the originator’s code immediately under the SSIC followed by a forward slash with no spaces before or after the slash, the classification (if classified) (FOUO for For Official Use Only, C for Confidential, S for Secret, TS for Top Secret), and then the next unused serial number for the current calendar year.
    * (3) **Date.** Date a letter on the same day it is signed. Do not type the date when preparing correspondence that will be signed on a later date. Use the abbreviated date format discussed in chapter 2, page 2-11.
* **b. Exceptions to Requirements for Using Identification Symbols.** Local practices determine how to use identification symbols in the following cases:
    * (1) Letters to members of Congress or heads of Government agencies.
    * (2) Letters of praise or condolence.
* **c. Unauthorized Identification Symbols.** Numbers assigned by word processing centers and the initials of writers and typists are unauthorized as identification symbols; however, they may be included on file copies as part of the drafter’s identification.

**4. Classified Correspondence.** You must have the appropriate security eligibility and access, and be trained as a derivative classifier on the marking/handling requirements prior to preparing classified correspondence. An example of a classified letter is provided in figure 7-5. Refer to DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 for additional information on marking and handling classified correspondence.

**5. For Official Use Only**
* **a.** For Official Use Only (FOUO) applies to information that is not classified, but which may be withheld from the public under the FOIA.
* **b.** Correspondence determined to contain FOUO information shall be marked per the requirements in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4, Enclosure 3, Section 2.c.

**6. “From:” Line**
* **a. General.** Every standard letter must have a “From:” line, except a letter that will be used with a window envelope. To prepare a letter for a window envelope, follow figure 7-3. As a general rule, the “From:” line is composed of the activity head’s title and the activity’s name. Refer to the three publications listed below for the correct names and mailing addresses for DON and DoD activities.
    * (1) SNDL
    * (2) Active Marine Link, Personal and Family Link, Military Personnel Services Link, Postal Link under reference.
    * (3) DoDAAD, DoD Manual 4000.25-6-M.
* **b. Converting an SNDL Address to a “From:” Line Address.** The “From:” line gives more than a title, but less than a full mailing address. Include enough information to distinguish your activity from other activities that may have the same name, but are in a different city or country. In some cases a one-of-kind title adequately identifies an activity and the location is unnecessary (e.g., “Secretary of the Navy”).
* **c. Format.** Type “From:” at the left margin on the second line below the date line. The text begins two spaces after the colon. If the entry is longer than one line, start the second line under the first word after the heading.
* **d. Avoid Multiple Titles.** If your commanding officer has more than one title, choose the title that corresponds with the content of the letter.

**7. “To:” Line**
* **a. General.** Address all correspondence to the activity head of an activity. Include the office code or person’s title that will act on your letter in parentheses, if known. If the office code is composed of only numbers, add the word “Code” before the numbers. Do not add the word “Code” before an office code that starts with a letter (e.g., “N” or “SUP”). Because frequent turnover in personnel can result in misrouted mail, avoid using the name of an individual in the “To:” line. You may use the complete mailing address and ZIP+4 code if you want the address for a record. If you will be using a window envelope, follow figure 7-3.
* **b. Format.** Type “To:” at the left margin on the first line under the “From:” line (do not skip a line). Six spaces follow the colon.

**8. “Via:” Line**
* **a. General.** Use a “Via:” line when one or more activities outside of your activity should review a letter before it reaches the action addressee. The format for the “Via:” line is the same as for the “From:” line and “To:” line discussed in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.
* **b. Format.** Type “Via:” at the left margin on the first line below the “To:” line. Five spaces follow the colon. If the entry is longer than one line, start the second line under the first word after the heading.
* **c. Numbering Via Addressees.** Number “Via” addressees if two or more are listed. Follow the chain of command. Routing starts with the addressee listed first.
* **d.** When one or more activities outside of your activity should review a letter before it reaches the action addressee, and TV-5 Taskers is the mechanism being used for routing the correspondence, do not use a “Via:” line. Prepare the appropriate Action Memorandum as outlined on page 12-4 of this manual.

**9. Subject Line**
* **a. General.** The subject line consists of a sentence fragment that tells readers what the letter is about. Use normal word order and capitalize every letter after the colon. In correspondence, do not use acronyms in the subject line. If the subject appears elsewhere in the text of the letter, capitalize it using the “Title Case” format. When replying to a letter, repeat the subject of the incoming correspondence in the subject line, unless a change is essential for clarity.
* **b. Format.** Type “Subj:” at the left margin on the second line under the last line of the previous heading. Three spaces follow the colon. If the entry is longer than one line, align the second line under the first word after the heading.

**10. Reference Line**
* **a. General.** Use only those references that bear directly on the subject at hand. Avoid unnecessary or complicated references. List references in the order they appear in the text. Always mention cited references in the text.
* **b. Avoiding Most NOTAL References.** A not-to-all (NOTAL) reference is a document that some addressees neither hold nor need. Avoid NOTAL references whenever possible. If a NOTAL reference is unavoidable, follow the reference in the reference line with the term “NOTAL” in parentheses.
    * (1) If it is known that the action addressee does not have a reference listed in your correspondence, include it as an enclosure to your correspondence or refer to it in the text.
    * (2) If you would like to provide a copy of a reference listed in your correspondence to a “Via” or “Copy to” addressee, annotate “w/ref (x)” in parentheses to the right of the addressee you send it to.
* **c. Format.** Type “Ref:” at the left margin on the second line below the subject line. Use a lowercase letter in parentheses before the description of every reference. If you have only one reference, list it as “Ref: (a)”. Four spaces follow the colon. References are listed in alphabetical order, a through z.
* **d. Citing Various Types of References.**
    * (1) **Naval correspondence:** (a) SNDL originator short title, (b) type (“ltr” or “memo”), (c) SSIC, (d) originator’s code/serial, (e) date.
    * (2) **Business letter:** (a) company name, (b) “ltr”, (c) date.
    * (3) **E-mail:** (a) SNDL originator short title, (b) “e-mail,” (c) type, (d) SSIC, (e) originator’s code, (f) date.
    * (4) **Message:** (a) originator's PLA, (b) complete date-time-group.
    * (5) **Telephone/Meeting:** (a) “PHONCON” or “Mtg”; (b) activity short title, office code, individual’s name, (c) date.
    * (6) **Navy Instruction:** (a) SNDL short title + “INST”, (b) SSIC with consecutive number and revision letter.
    * (7) **Navy Notice:** (a) SNDL short title + “NOTE” + SSIC, (b) serial number, (c) date, (d) cancellation date.
    * (18) **“My” and “Your” Optional.** To cite an earlier communication between your activity and the action addressee, you may substitute a personal pronoun for the issuing activity.

**11. Enclosure Line**
* **a. General.** List enclosures in the enclosure line in the order they appear in the text. Identify an enclosure using the same format as you would when identifying a reference.
* **b. Format.** Type “Encl:” at the left margin on the second line below the last line of the previous heading. Three spaces follow the colon. Use a number in parentheses before the description of every enclosure, even if you have only one.
* **c. Normal Distribution.** Normally, send one copy of the basic letter plus any enclosures to all addressees. Do not use the term “w/encl”.
* **d. Adding Copies.** When sending more than one copy of an enclosure to all addressees, note the quantity in parentheses after the enclosure's description.
* **g. Sending Enclosures Separately.** Type the term “sep cover” in parentheses after the enclosure's description.

**12. Text.** Start the text on the second line down from the previous entry. The text shall be left justified. Make the content clear by using plain English. Do not use slang or jargon. Within the text, spell out all acronyms the first time used.

**13. Paragraphs.** Start all continuation lines at the left margin. All paragraphs are single spaced and each paragraph or subparagraph begins on the second line below the previous paragraph or subparagraph. When using a subparagraph, the first line is always indented the appropriate number of spaces depending on the level of subparagraphing.
* **a. Identifying Paragraphs.** Identify all paragraphs or subparagraphs with a number or letter. (See Figure 7-8).
* **c. Citing Paragraphs.** When citing a paragraph or subparagraph, write the numbers and letters without periods or spaces. *Example: 2b(4)(a)*
* **d. Paragraph Headings.** Use paragraph headings in long correspondence with widely varying topics. Be brief but informative. Underline any heading and capitalize its key words using the Title Case format.

**14. Signature Line**
* **a. General.**
    * (1) Only the original, which goes to the action addressee, must be signed; however, the original and all copies must have typed or stamped signature line information below the signature. The last name appears in all capital letters with the exception of a last name beginning with a prefix.
    * (2) Start all lines of the signature line at the center of the page, beginning on the fourth line below the text.
* **b. Examples of Signature Lines**
    * (1) **Activity Head:** Name only.
    * (2) **By Title:** Name, then Title.
    * (3) **Acting:** Name, then Title, then "Acting".
    * (4) **By Direction:** Name, then "By direction".

**15. “Copy To:” Line**
* **a. General.** Use this optional line to list addressees outside your activity who need to know a letter's content but do not need to act on it.
* **b. Format.** Type "Copy to:" at the left margin on the second line below the signature line.

**16. Identifying Second and Later Pages.** Repeat the subject line at the top of each page of the basic letter. Start typing at the left margin on the sixth line from the top of the page or set margins to 1 inch. Continue the text beginning on the second line below the subject.

**17. Page Numbering.** Do not number a single-page letter or the first page of a multiple-page letter. Center page numbers 1/2 inch from the bottom edge, starting with the number 2.

Subj:  WINDOW-ENVELOPE FORMAT

1.  You may use a GSA general-purpose window envelope (overall size 9-1/2 by
4-1/8 inches and window, 4-3/4 by 1-1/4 inches, in lower left) if:

    a.  The address has no more than five lines, and does not extend past the

a 1/8-inch margin, even if the letter shifts in the envelope.

    b.  The letter and enclosures are all unclassified.

    c.  Your letter does not have any “Via” addresses.

2.  Because this letter does not have a “From:” line, every copy that goes to
addressees outside your activity must be on letterhead to show its origin.

3.  To fold the letter, first turn up the bottom edge so it just covers the
subject, second, turn back the address portion so the upper fold also falls along
the top of the subject.
