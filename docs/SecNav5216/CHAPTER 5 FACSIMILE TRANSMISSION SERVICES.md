# CHAPTER 5: FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION SERVICES

## 5-1 General

**General.** Facsimile machines provide a rapid and reliable alternative to the various mail systems for the transmission of documents. Whatever you send by facsimile must be for official Government business or for authorized purposes (as defined by the Joint Ethics Regulations section 2-301 (DoD 5500.7-R)).

## 5-2 Procedures

**1. Managing Facsimile Services**
* **a.** Limit transmissions requiring use of long distance services to time sensitive communications only.
* **b.** Send multiple documents that are going to the same location in batches rather than one at a time.
* **c.** Facsimile transmission cover sheets add to the cost of each transmission. Keep cover sheets as simple and functional as possible, with only essential information. Avoid graphics and heavy gray or black areas because they slow transmissions and increase costs.
    * (1) Instead of using separate cover sheets when sending material via facsimile transmission, commands are encouraged to procure a rubber stamp (1 inch by 4 inches) formatted as follows:
        > *[Standard Facsimile Rubber Stamp Format]*
    * (2) Place the stamp at either the top, bottom, or side margin. This will eliminate the need for an extra page and save money, material, labor, energy, and time.

**2. Security and Privacy Issues**
* **a.** Do not transmit classified data via unsecured facsimile equipment. See DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3 and SECNAVINST 5211.5E, *Department of the Navy Privacy Act (PA) Program*, for more information regarding transmitting classified material via facsimile equipment.
* **b.** The use of fax machines to send information containing the SSN and other PII by DON personnel is prohibited except under the following circumstances:
    * (1) When another more secure means of transmitting PII is not practical.
    * (2) When a process outside of DON control requires faxing to activities such as the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), TRICARE, the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), etc.
    * (3) In cases where operational necessity requires expeditious handling.
    * (4) When faxing PII related to internal government operations, i.e., office phone number, rank, job title, etc.
    * (5) When sending a fax, utilize a Privacy Act Data Cover Sheet (DD Form 2923) and verify receipt by the correct addressee.
    * (6) External customers such as Veterans, Air Force and Army personnel, dependents, and retirees may continue to fax documents containing the SSN to DON activities but shall be strongly encouraged to use an alternative means. Alternatives to the use of fax machines include:
        * (a) Sending documents via the United States Postal Service.
        * (b) Scanned documents transmitted using a secure means such as encrypted e-mails.
* **c.** Follow established guidelines and exercise good judgment in transmitting sensitive information. See page 4-2, paragraph 4.

**3. Records Management**
* **a.** Correspondence transmitted via a facsimile machine has the same authority as if it were the original. Normally the original is retained by the sending activity. The sender determines whether the correspondence is important enough to forward the original. If the original is forwarded, the advance copy may become non-record material or it may be part of a greater records “collection” or package and therefore must be managed accordingly. Non-record material may be destroyed by the receiving office once the original is received.
* **b.** Activities that receive many official documents via facsimile may need to procure a rubber stamp such as the one shown below to assist in identifying documents that are to be retained for record purposes.
