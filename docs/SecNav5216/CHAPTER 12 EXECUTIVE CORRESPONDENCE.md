# CHAPTER 12: EXECUTIVE CORRESPONDENCE

## 12-1 General

**General.** This section provides specific guidance on the internal and external written communication particular to the Headquarters, Department of the Navy (HqDON). When forwarding correspondence to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Military Departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, the Defense Agencies, the Department of Defense (DoD) Field Activities, and all other organizational entities within the DoD and HqDON, every effort should be made to strictly adhere to prescribed formats, as deviation could unnecessarily delay processing for administrative action or complete restaffing.

---

## 12-2 Processes

**1. Correspondence Management.** HqDON correspondence is safeguarded and electronically routed, reviewed, and edited through the Department of the Navy Tasking, Records and Consolidated Knowledge Enterprise Repository (DON TRACKER). DON TRACKER is a Web-based computer tracking system that is utilized as a contexts manager for all official action and information correspondence for HqDON and selected echelon 2 commands.

**2. Assigning Action to Incoming Correspondence.** All action or information correspondence received in HqDON is analyzed and routed to the appropriate office by the tasking authority for clarity of purpose and intent, action, coordination, or information.
* **a. Office of the Secretary and Under Secretary of the Navy.** All action or information correspondence for the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, Administrative Office (1000 Navy Pentagon, Room 4D652, Washington, DC 20350) is controlled, routed, and safeguarded.
    * (1) Upon receipt, general and congressional correspondence shall be routed to an executive civilian or staff assistant per SECNAVINST 5430.7R, *Assignment of Responsibilities and Authorities in the Office of the Secretary of the Navy*, and assigned as the action office to facilitate coordination and review via Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) or Under Secretary of the Navy (UNSECNAV) signature.
    * (2) Operational correspondence shall be assigned to the Director, Navy Staff or the Director, Marine Corps Staff, as appropriate, for action or coordination to prepare proposed responses for SECNAV or UNSECNAV signature.
    * (3) When coordination is required by both Navy and Marine Corps, the Office of the Secretary of the Navy will determine who shall be the appropriate lead action office.
* **b. Office of the Chief and Vice Chief of Naval Operations.** All action or information correspondence for the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) signature is controlled, routed, and safeguarded by the Office of the Director, Navy Staff, Attn: Executive Secretary (2000 Navy Pentagon, Room 4E563, Washington, DC 20350).
* **c. Office of the Commandant and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps.** All action or information correspondence for the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) or Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps (ACMC) signature is controlled, routed, and safeguarded by the Office of the Director, Marine Corps Staff (3000 Marine Corps Pentagon, Room 4E448, Washington, DC 20350).

**3. Routing Changes.** Changes to action office assignment shall be made within 48 hours of initial assignment. If the package requires transfer to another agency or office after that time, the original action office shall coordinate with the receiving office. Prior to transferring action, provide tasking authority with the name, organization, and telephone number of the new action office.

**4. Due Dates.**
* **a. General Correspondence.** All general correspondence should be responded to within 10 working days of being entered into DON TRACKER. If additional time is required, an interim letter and/or an approved extension are mandatory.
* **b. Congressional Correspondence.** All Congressional correspondence should be responded to within five working days of being entered into DON TRACKER. If additional time is required, an interim letter will be sent.

**5. Extensions.** To request an extension of an OSD tasker, the action office must provide the necessary information and prepare an official extension request with a SD Form 391, Secretary of Defense Correspondence Action Report. The action office will also need to provide a copy of the proposed interim that will be sent to the correspondent. All documents shall be placed in the attachments area of DON TRACKER.

**6. Interims.**
* **a. HqDON Correspondence.**
    * (1) An interim response shall be provided in the event the tasker cannot be answered within the allotted time. It shall be used to acknowledge receipt of the tasker or letter, but more importantly, to signal the desire to be responsive. The interim response will provide an overview of the information available; the reason for the delay, along with a reasonable anticipated date that the final reply shall be provided.
    * (2) It is the responsibility of the action office to ensure timely planning in the preparation of interim responses. There shall be no extensions given in order to complete an interim letter. The action office concerned shall forward a copy of all interim responses to SECNAV Admin for retention. Subsequent interims shall be approved by the Administrative Aide to the Secretary of the Navy (AASN).
* **b. OSD Correspondence.** An interim response shall be prepared in accordance with paragraph 6a. The interim response shall be signed out at the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (ASN) level.
* **c. Congressional Correspondence.** An interim response is required in the event the tasker cannot be answered within the allotted time.

**7. Distribution.** A signed/dated copy of the correspondence with a copy of the action memo, references, and background materials shall be returned to the action office. Only a signed copy of the response shall be forwarded to the coordinating offices.

## 12-3 General Guidelines for Preparing a Letter

**General.** Use letters for correspondence with individuals outside the U.S. Government and for formal correspondence with officials of other Federal agencies.

**1. Stationery.** Prepare all outgoing correspondence for SECNAV, CNO, or designated official signature on the following letterhead:
* **a.** Use flag stationery (refer to figures 12-7 and 12-8) for personal correspondence. Use plain bond for successive pages.
* **b.** Use SECNAV/UNSECNAV letterhead with DoD seal for official correspondence (i.e., SECNAV addressed letters, business and personal, or official responses to outside government officials). Use plain bond paper for successive pages. Additionally, use the DON, Office of the Secretary of the Navy (refer to figure 12-2) when authorized to sign on behalf of SECNAV (i.e., SECNAV instructions, notices, and “reply direct” action responses).

**2. Format.** Prepare all correspondence using Times New Roman Font, 12 point.
* **a. Salutations.** All salutations shall be formal. The following guidance can be used to prepare salutations, text for the body of the letter, closing lines, complimentary close and signature line:
* **b. Opening Lines**
    * (1) “Thank you for your letter/correspondence (if email) of (date – November 6, 2005 – only use date if response is timely) concerning...”
    * (2) “Thank you for your recent letter(s) concerning...”
    * (3) “I am responding on behalf of...”
* **c. Body of the Letter**
    * (1) Limit the use of “I” and “we.”
    * (2) Each paragraph must be indented ½ inch. Do not number the paragraphs.
    * (3) Limit response to one page whenever possible. Use enclosures if necessary.
    * (4) An acronym may be used after it is spelled out (be consistent throughout the document), except in the subject line or title.
    * (5) Spell out percent (instead of using the sign “%”).
    * (6) In replying to more than one member of Congress, you may use either:
        * (a) “A similar response has been sent to Senator(s) (last name) and Congressman/Congressmen (last name(s)).”
        * (b) “A similar response has been sent to each of your colleagues who also expressed an interest in this issue.”
* **d. Closing Lines (last paragraph)**
    * (1) “Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.”
    * (2) “I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts on this issue.”
    * (3) “If I may be of any further assistance, please let me know.” (Preferred on Congressional responses.)
* **e. Signature Lines**
    * (1) Leave out the signature block on memorandums for Secretary of Defense (SecDef), Deputy Secretary of Defense (DepSecDef), SECNAV, and UNSECNAV signature, unless otherwise directed by the aforementioned principal.
    * (2) Correspondence prepared for the signature of other officials should contain standard closing and signature lines.
    * (3) The following is a sample of the signature line:
        * (a) Type the name at the center of the page on fourth line below the last line of text or complimentary close.
        * (b) Type the official title on the line below his/her name commencing at the center of the page as well.
* **f. Copy To.** When writing a member of Congress in the capacity of Committee Chairman, send a courtesy copy to the Committee ranking minority member (see figures 12-4, 12-5, and 12- 6). Indicate the “Copy to” addressee at the bottom left of the letter (two lines after signature line).

**3. Date Line.** Do not type the date on correspondence to be signed. Correspondence will be dated by SECNAV Admin once the signature has been obtained.

**4. Complimentary Closing.** Use “Sincerely,” followed by comma for the complimentary close for routine and congressional correspondence. Start the complimentary close at the center of the page on the second line below the text. Use “Sincerely,” for complimentary close of a flag personal letter. The following list of suggested complimentary closings for personal correspondence is not all inclusive: “Respectfully,” (Flag/General Officers junior in rank to signer), “Very respectfully,” (Flag/General Officers senior in rank to signer), “Warm regards” (Thank You, Birth announcements and condolences, etc), “Sincerely yours,” or “With great respect,” (High ranking civilians, Senators, Congressmen/women, Governors, etc), and “Sincerely,” or “All the best,” (All others).

**5. Page Numbering.** Number second and succeeding pages at the bottom center of the page allowing at least a double space below the last line of text and 1/2 inch from the bottom of the page.

**6. Congressional Committees or Subcommittees Correspondence.** Responses addressed to chairpersons of Congressional committees or subcommittees are of particular importance and require additional guidance. Address the response to the chairperson with a courtesy copy to the ranking minority member. The closing paragraph will specify other chairpersons receiving a similar response. Examples of acceptable closing paragraphs are provided in this chapter. SECNAV will sign all correspondence addressed to the chairpersons of Congressional committees or subcommittees except for routine reports to Congress. Correspondence addressing significant or high profile issues will also be signed by SECNAV. Deviation from this policy must be requested and approved through the CLO.
