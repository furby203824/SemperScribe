# CHAPTER 9: ENDORSEMENTS

## 9-1 General

**General.** When a letter is transmitted via your activity, use an endorsement to forward comments, recommendations, or information. While an endorsement is mostly used to transmit correspondence through the chain of command, you may also use it to redirect a letter. Do not use an endorsement to reply to a routine letter. Additionally, a “Via” addressee may alter the order of any remaining “Via” addressees or add others. The length of the endorsement and the amount of space that is available on the basic letter or on the preceding endorsement determines if you should use a same-page or new page endorsement. If it will completely fit on the signature page of the basic letter or the preceding endorsement, you may add it to that page. If not, use a new-page endorsement.

---

## 9-2 Format

**1. Endorsement Line**
* **a.** Start the endorsement line at the left margin on the second line below the date line. If the correspondence is classified, start the endorsement line on the second line below the classification line. When preparing a same-page endorsement, as long as the entire page will be photocopied, you may omit the SSIC, subject and the basic letter’s identification symbols.
* **b.** Number each endorsement in the sequence in which it is added to the basic letter. Indicate the numbers of the endorsement by using ordinal numbers such as FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, etc. Following the number, type “ENDORSEMENT on” and identify the basic letter using the same style as a reference line. When the heading exceeds one line, start the succeeding line with the word “on”.

**2. “Via:” Line.** When preparing your endorsement, include in the “Via:” line any remaining “Via” addressees, if any. If there is only one via addressee remaining, do not number it. If there is more than one remaining, number the remaining addresses starting with the number (1) in parenthesis and consecutively number the rest.

**3. Adding References.** Do not repeat a reference in the reference line of your endorsement that has already been identified in the reference line of the basic letter or a previous endorsement. Identify only the references that you add. Assign a letter to all references you add by continuing the sequence of letters from the basic letter and previous endorsements. For example, if the basic letter and previous endorsements had references identified up to letter “f,” the first reference of your endorsement would be letter “g.”

**4. Adding Enclosures.** Do not repeat an enclosure in your enclosure line that has already been identified in the enclosure line of the basic letter or prior endorsements. Identify only the enclosures that you add. Assign a number to all enclosures that you add by continuing the sequence of numbers from the basic letter and previous endorsements. For example, if the basic letter and previous endorsements had enclosures identified up to number “5,” the first enclosure of your endorsement would be number “6.”

**5. “Copy To:” Addressees.** If your endorsement is significant and not routine, each activity that endorsed the basic letter before you and the originator of the basic letter shall be included as a copy to addressee on your endorsement. Additionally, all copy to addressees from the basic letter and previous endorsements shall be included as a copy to addressee. Significant endorsements include “forwarded, recommending disapproval,” “readdressed and forwarded,” and those with substantive comments. Routine endorsements include “forwarded,” “forwarded for consideration,” and “forwarded, recommending approval.”

**6. Forwarding Your Endorsement and Copies.** When forwarding your endorsement to the next via addressee or to the action addressee, you must also do the following:
* **a.** Attach any enclosure you identified in your endorsement to the original for forwarding to the action addressee.
* **b.** Forward one copy of your endorsement to each remaining addressee.
* **c.** Forward one copy of your endorsement to each copy to addressee. Include a copy of any enclosure you added. If a copy to addressee will be receiving the basic letter and previous endorsements for the first time from you, to the right of each of these addressees, type the word “complete” in parentheses to show that your endorsement includes the basic letter, enclosures, and prior endorsements.

**7. Assembly of an Endorsement.** Figure 9-2 shows a suggested way to assemble an endorsement for signature and mailing.
