# CHAPTER 8: MULTIPLE-ADDRESS LETTER

## 8-1 General

**General.** Use a multiple-address letter when you have more than one action addressee. The multiple-address letter is the same as the standard letter, except in handling addresses. Separate standard letters may be used in place of a multiple-address letter, but they require much more work.

---

## 8-2 Listing Addressees

There are three ways to list addresses:

**1. Using a “To:” Line Only.** When you have four addresses or fewer, use the “To:” line by itself as shown in figure 8-1.

**2. Using a “Distribution:” Line Only.** When you have more than four addresses, use the “Distribution:” line by itself as shown in figure 8-2.

**3. Using Both a “To:” Line and “Distribution:” Line.** Use both the “To:” line and the “Distribution:” line in the same letter when you show a group title whose distribution is relatively unknown. Place the group title (“Area Records Officers,” for example) in the “To:” line and identify each member in a “Distribution:” line. See figure 8-3.

---

## 8-3 Preparing and Signing Copies

Every action addressee must receive a letter that has a letterhead and signature. The letterhead may be printed, typed, stamped, or photocopied. The signature must be original or photocopied. To meet these requirements, make copies the following way: Type original on letterhead paper. After the original has been signed, make the necessary photocopies. Keep the original signed copy in the official file and send out photocopies.

## 8-4 Assembly of Multiple-Address Letters

Figure 8-4 shows a suggested way to assemble a multiple-address letter for signature and mailing.

Subj: USING A “DISTRIBUTION:” LINE ONLY

1.  Omit the “To:” line and add a “Distribution:” line if you have more than
four action addressees or if you vary the number of copies to any of the
addressees. Addressees shown in a “Distribution:” line are action addressees.

2.  You may list addressees in the “Distribution:” line by:
    a. SNDL short titles
    b. Collective titles, or
    c. Both collective and SNDL short title.

3.  Usually list “Distribution:” and “Copy to:” addressees in single columns.
Addressees may be listed in paragraphs or columns to keep a letter from going
to another page.
