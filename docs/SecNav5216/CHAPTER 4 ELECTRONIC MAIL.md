# CHAPTER 4: ELECTRONIC MAIL

## 4-1 General

**General.** E-mail allows individuals and activities to exchange information by computer. You may use it for informal communications in place of telephone calls or to transmit formal correspondence. The Defense Data Network must be used for long-haul data communications support, unless the host system is waived. Correspondence you send by e-mail must be for official Government business or for authorized purposes (as defined by the Joint Ethics Regulations section 2-301 (DoD 5500.7-R)). E-mails are subject to legal discovery, therefore, care should be taken to ensure e-mails are created and managed appropriately per SECNAVINST 5000.37.

## 4-2 Procedures

**1. Managing E-mail.** Activities shall establish procedures for accessing and managing e-mail. Among other things, they must:
* **a.** Prohibit users from sharing mailboxes or passwords.
* **b.** Encourage users to check their mailboxes frequently, but at least twice a day.
* **c.** If you are absent for more than 3 business days, ensure you annotate that in your automated e-mail response. Provide a point of contact for e-mails requiring immediate response.
* **d.** Provide for periodic review of e-mail files to purge, retain, or file, as appropriate.

**2. Formal Correspondence.** Activity heads may authorize the use of e-mail to correspond formally. Your delegation of signature authority for correspondence is also your release authority for e-mail. When corresponding formally:
* **a.** Use standard DON correspondence formats including an SSIC, serial number, date, and signature authority.
* **b.** Type in your letterhead information to identify the originating organization.
* **c. Complimentary Closing.** The following list of suggested complimentary closings for e-mail communication is not all inclusive: “Sincerely yours” or “With great respect” (Civilians) “Respectfully” (Junior in rank to signer), and “Very respectfully” (Senior in rank to signer). “Respectfully” and “Very respectfully” may be abbreviated in a reply to an initial e-mail (“V/r,” and “R/,”).
* **d.** Use “/s/” in place of the signature.
* **e.** Follow your chain of command.
* **f.** Transmit only from your authorized e-mail address.
* **g.** Request acknowledgement of receipt in the original communication when it is required. Acknowledgement may be via e-mail.
* **h.** Keep a copy of any formal correspondence sent by e-mail as your activity’s file copy (see paragraph 5 below).

**3. Informal Correspondence.** There are no specific guidelines for informal correspondence; however, keep it brief, use good taste, and observe traditional customs and courtesies. Do not use a complete signature line to identify the sender, but the sender must be fully identified. You may omit the signature line entirely if your computer automatically identifies the sender.

**4. Security and Privacy Issues.**
* **a.** Do not send classified information by e-mail unless the system, including the network, is protected for the highest level of classified information you are sending. Refer to SECNAVINST 5239.3B, *Department of the Navy Information Assurance Policy*, and SECNAVINST 5211.5E, *Department of the Navy Privacy Act (PA) Program*, for additional guidance on automated information system security and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2, *DoD Information Security Program: Marking of Classified Information*, for proper marking and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3, *DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information*, for safeguarding.
* **b.** Follow established guidelines and exercise good judgment in transmitting sensitive information such as:
    * (1) Government information that would be of value to an adversary.
    * (2) Pre-award contractual information, budget information, or authorization data.
    * (3) Non-government information such as trade secrets the Government agreed to keep confidential.
    * (4) “For Official Use Only” information.
    * (5) When transmitting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) via e-mail, the e-mail must be digitally signed and encrypted, all recipients must have an official need to know, and the e-mail must be marked in accordance with SECNAVINST 5211.5E.

**5. Records Management.** E-mail lacks the built-in records management controls of the Naval Computer and Telecommunications System (NCTS) and the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN). An e-mail can be considered a record (see chapter 3, section 3-1, of this manual for the definition of an electronic record). Activities will control the creation, use, maintenance, and disposition of e-mail records. Follow chapter 3 of this manual and SECNAV M-5210.1.

**6. Digital Signatures.** DON policy for digital signatures continues to evolve. However, two uses of digital signature have been established. In accordance with SECNAVINST 5239.3B, commanders of DON organizations shall ensure e-mail messages requiring either message integrity or non-repudiation are digitally signed using DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). All e-mail containing an attachment or embedded active content must be digitally signed. Per DoD guidance (USD P&R Memo, *Policy for Digital Signature Functionality and Acceptance*, of 12 December 2006), digital signatures will be recognized and accepted as valid for all human resource management documents.
