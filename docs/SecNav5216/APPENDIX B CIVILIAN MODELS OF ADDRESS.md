# APPENDIX B: CIVILIAN MODELS OF ADDRESS

**1.** The following examples of civilian models of address, salutation, and complimentary close are used in the preparation of Navy business-format letters. They may be varied depending on circumstances.

**2.** Use “The Honorable (Name)” in the address of Presidential appointees as well as Federal and state elected officials. Avoid “The Honorable” in addresses of county and city officials, except for mayors.

**3.** Use the title “Madam” in the salutation of a letter to a high-level woman diplomat or government official, such as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Use the title “Madam” in salutations of letters destined for women foreign heads of state and diplomats.

**4.** Use the title “Ms.” when addressing a woman by her surname (Ms. Jones). However, “Ms.,” like “Mr.,” indicates nothing with regard to a person’s marital status. Therefore, use “Miss” or “Mrs.” in the salutation when an incumbent or correspondent has indicated this preference. Never use “Ms.” with a woman’s full married name; e.g., “Ms. John E. Doe” is incorrect. Use “Mr.” with a position or surname if you don’t know the addressee’s gender and can’t find out readily.
