## 6-2 Procedures

**1. Choosing the Right Size Envelope or Container.** Use envelopes or mailing containers only slightly larger than the material being mailed and of sufficient strength to protect the contents during the mail handling process. Envelopes should be no smaller than 3 1/2 inches by 5 inches and no larger than 6 1/8 inches by 11 1/2 inches, if possible. Mail smaller than 3 1/2 inches by 5 inches cannot be mailed. You can send mail that is larger than 6 1/8 inches by 11 1/2 inches; however, it must bypass automated equipment and be processed through slower and less efficient methods. Reduce mailing expenses by following these steps:
* **a.** Use standard letter size (number 10) envelopes whenever possible. Generally, documents with six or less pages should be folded and mailed in a letter size envelope rather than a larger size envelope. See figure 6-1. The USPS automated processing equipment cannot handle envelopes thicker than 1/4 inch.
* **b.** Use large envelopes for material that cannot be folded (photographs, diplomas, negatives, and bulk material).
* **c.** Consolidate by class, all mail generated on the same day and destined for the same addressee.
* **d.** Check with your mailroom for activities/agencies within the local area that are serviced by couriers, as this requires no postage.

**2. Sources of Address Information.** Address official Navy mail to the command or activity addresses in:
* **a.** SNDL (http://doni.documentservices.dla.mil/sndl.aspx)
* **b.** Active Marine Link, Personal and Family Link, Military Personnel Services Link, Postal Link, under reference) (https://www.manpower.usmc.mil/portal/page/portal/M_RA_HOME)
* **c.** Department of Defense Activity Address Directory (DoDAAD), DLM 4000.25, Vol. 6 (https://www2.dla.mil/j-6/dlmso/elibrary/Manuals/DLM/V6/Volume6.pdf)

**3. Delivery and Return Address Formats**
* **a. Requirements**
    * (1) Be sure you have the correct address and use organizational codes whenever possible.
    * (2) Type, or print by other mechanical means, the delivery address in uppercase letters. Use no punctuation except for the hyphen in the ZIP+4 code. Use black or blue-black ribbon or ink. The return address may be preprinted, typewritten, or rubber stamped.
    * (3) If available, use the ZIP+4 code and USPS acceptable abbreviations. Figure 6-2 is a listing of USPS acceptable abbreviations for streets and words that often appear in the names of places. A listing of acceptable USPS two-letter State and territory abbreviations appears in figure 6-3.
    * (4) Do not use print styles that:
        * (a) Incorporate proportional spacing,
        * (b) Have characters that overlap,
        * (c) Have highly styled characters such as script, italics, artistic, etc., or
        * (d) Have dots that do not touch to form each letter (dot matrix styles).
    * (5) Limit official mail addresses (both delivery and return) to five lines. Format with a uniform left margin and a maximum of 47 characters per line, including spaces.
    * (6) Center the address and single-space each line, blocked one below the other. Do not indent lines. Leave at least a l-inch margin from the left and right edges of the envelope and at least 5/8 inch from the bottom of the envelope. The last line of the address should be no lower than 5/8 inch and the top line of the address should be no higher than 2 1/4 inches from the bottom of the envelope. Include all required information within addressee and return addressee areas. Do not type in the margins or clear area. Do not overlap the return address in the delivery address area. Be careful not to slant the address. The lines must be parallel to the top and bottom edges of the envelope. Refer to figure 6-4 for placement and format.
* **b. Mail Sent Within the DoD.** Prepare the address as follows:
    * (1) **Non-address Data Line - First Line (Optional).** Use this to address official correspondence to the official in charge, such as commanding officer, director, commander, etc.
    * (2) **Information/Attention Line - Second Line (Optional).** If known, place the name of the action officer, a specific individual, or section and code here.
    * (3) **Name of Recipient Line - Third Line.** Place the activity short title (less the city and state) here.
    * (4) **Delivery Address Line - Fourth Line.** Place either a street address or post office box number here. Use the word “SUITE” to designate locations within a building. See figure 6-2 for acceptable USPS street and places abbreviations.
    * (5) **Post Office Line - Fifth Line.** Place the city, state, and ZIP+4 code (in that order) here. Use the standard two-letter abbreviations shown in figure 6-3.

**4. Mail Classifications.** Select the class of mail service that meets the security, accountability, and delivery requirements of the material being shipped at the most economical cost. See OPNAVINST 5218.7C for the definitions of classes of mail and special supplemental postal services.

**5. Mail Markings.** Mark all mail, except first-class mail in a standard letter size (number 10) envelope, with the class of mail service you desire. Place the marking, i.e., first-class, priority, etc., in the upper right corner, about 1/4 inch below the postage meter imprint, mail stamp, or permit imprint. Mailings without a class of mail marking, except those in a number 10 envelope, will be assumed to contain no first-class material and will be sent as the lowest possible class of service.
